# Simple Event
This is a homemade Wordpress plugin to cater for the need to manage the display of events.

This is my personal project and will not be maintaining it.

I have decided to share this because open-source has helped me during my plugin development.

## Status
This plugin is still under development. It is not completed.

## External Library
* [CMB2](https://github.com/CMB2/CMB2) to build forms

## Requirement
* [Font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for shortcodes only. You can live without it but make sure to modify shortcodes first!!! (Hint, just remove the ul and li classes.)

## Getting Started
1. Commit this repo under a root plugin folder named `simple-event` or folder name of your choice.
2. Activate from admin.
3. If you want hint on how to display events, look in `simple-event/includes/shortcodes.php`. This is how you can display custom post types!
